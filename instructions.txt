OBJECTIVE: Rotate and move each falling Tetromino
           to complete horizontal lines.
     - If a line is completed (no empty spaces),
        it will disappear and a point per line will be
        added to your score. Every 20 lines cleared, 
        the block will fall faster.
     - If a Tetromino cannot fall because the blocks
        have been built up too high, the game will end
        and a reset button will appear to restart the game.
How to move pieces:
     - Right arrow key moves the piece to the right.
     - Left arrow key moves the piece to the left.
     - Up arrow key drops the block as far as it can fall.
     - Down arrow key increases the falling speed (while pressed).
     - Space bar rotates the piece (clockwise).
     - "S" switches the current block with the next block (can't switch back
        until the next block comes into play);
     - "P" pauses the game.
